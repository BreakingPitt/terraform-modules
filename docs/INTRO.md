This project contain a group of base [Terraform](http://terraform.io) modules that will help you to build the infrastructure you need from your projects. This modules aim to serve as a tool to create individual resources on different providers, they are minimal and focus on each specific resource as an unique element.

> Note: If you are looking for a more complex combination of resources and modules we built as well [terraform-stack](https://github.com/moltin/terraform-stack) it will give you a stack of resources to speed up the process of creating a new infrastructure.

This project has been highly inspired by the work of others that have decided to share with the community their work, check the [resources](#resources) section for more info.
